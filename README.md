# OCR Microservice Setup Guide
## Introduction
If you're looking to create an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) microservice, this guide can help. The service will be capable of accepting images as input and returning the extracted text.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes several open-source technologies:

Python: A versatile programming language.
FastAPI: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
Tesseract: An OCR engine that offers support for various languages.
Redis: An in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.
Celery: An asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing.
Docker: A set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

## Getting Started
To build your own OCR service for free using these tools, you can find basic guidelines and instructions in the repository linked here. This setup allows for easy scaling and robust performance for OCR tasks.

## Detailed Instructions
For step-by-step instructions on how to set up your OCR microservice, please visit the following article: Building a FastAPI OCR Microservice (https://hackernoon.com/building-a-fastapi-ocr-microservice) .

By following the guide, you will be able to deploy a fully functional OCR microservice that can be incorporated into various applications requiring text extraction from images.
